# Principles of Research Presentation

To convey information and request feedback, you need to give presentations.
Duration can vary from 1 minutes to 1 hour. Here are some principles that you
should keep in mind and practice.

## Be aware of your purpose

What are you going to give a presentation for?

1. An introduction about your research career.
1. An introduction about what you did.
1. An introduction about what you are doing now.
1. An update of the progress of your current project (w/ or w/o slides).
1. A presentation of your paper at a conference (w/ slides)
1. A presentation to advertise yourself and seek collaboration (w/ slides).

## Be aware of your audience

Who are you going to give the presentation to?

1. Your supervisor.
1. People who join your group meeting.
1. People who have a similar background.
1. People outside of your committee.

## Budget your time

How long are you going to give the presentation?

1. Quickly
1. At length

## Prepare your presentation

1. Prepare, update, and practice the speech text.
2. For purpose 1/2/3, the speech text is usually fixed.
3. For purpose 5/6, make the speech text just before you are about to give a presentation.

## Make slides

1. [Susan McConnell (Stanford): Designing effective scientific presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ)
    - We are good listeners and let's transfer the knowledge to make slides

### Consider the attention curve
+ https://ethos3.com/hacking-the-audience-attention-curve/
+ split the talk into parts and summary the key message for each part
+ highlight the key messages with both text and the soundtrack, which will increase the attention
+ write down the key messages first and fill up the rest of space

### A simple style

+ one font (Calibri)
+ large font size (24, 28, 36, 52) and less text
+ sentence in one line
+ built-in list
+ box for the key summary
+ backup slides

### Animation
+ too much text and show them one by one

## Rehearsal and dry-run

1. Talk to others and ask feedback.
2. Give a high level overview of your answer in the beginning and then give the remaining details of your answer.
