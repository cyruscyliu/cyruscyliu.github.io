# Principles of Research Presentation 

To convey information and request feedback, you need to give
presentations in group meetings, defense meetings and
invited talks. You may be required to give an oral and short
introduction or to demonstrate your ideas with slides and answer
questions in 1 hour. Here are some principles that you should keep in
mind and practice in your daily research.

## Be aware of your purpose - Time and Topic 

You will be required to give presentations in the following scenario.

1. A brief introduction about your research career.

1. A presentation to defend your dissertation, thesis, proposal, Post

Scenario 1-5 are common in group meetings, 6 and 7 are common in defense
meetings, while scenario 8 is for invited talks.

You have to be aware of your purpose to give a presentation because it
decides how much time you have and what topics you should include.

## Be aware of your audience - Context and Tricks

different backgrounds and expectations.
