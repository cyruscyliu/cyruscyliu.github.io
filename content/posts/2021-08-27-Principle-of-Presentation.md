# Principles of Research Presentation

Giving a clear, attractive, and convincing oral representation is one of the
keys to keep you competitive, especially in front of people who do not share
common values with you (most likely).

## Be aware of the time budget

1. 1-minute elevator pitch (w/o slides).
1. 1-minute update of your current progress (w/o slides).
1. 5-minute update of your current progress (w/ slides).
1. 15-minute conference talk (w/ slides).
1. 45-minute invited talk (w/ slides).
1. 45-minute job talk (w/ slides).
1. 90-minute lecture (w/ slides).

## Be aware of your audience

1. People who share the common values.
1. People who join your group meeting.
1. People who have a similar background.
1. People outside of your committee.

## Prepare your presentation

1. Write down the speech text.
1. Make slides.
1. Practice.
1. Dry run, answer questions, and take feedback.
1. Perform.

### Make slides

1. [Susan McConnell (Stanford): Designing effective scientific presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ)
    - We are good listeners and let's transfer the knowledge to make slides
2. One slide, one topic sentence, 4-5 sentences, 1 minute
3. Consider the attention curve
    + https://ethos3.com/hacking-the-audience-attention-curve/
    + Split the talk into parts and summary the key message for each part
    + Write down the key messages first and fill up the rest of space
    + Highlight the key messages with both text and the soundtrack
4. A simple style
    + One font (Calibri)
    + Large font size (24, 28, 36, 52) and less text
    + Sentence in one line
    + Built-in list
    + Box for the key summary
    + Backup slides
5. Animation
    + Too much text and show them one by one

### Practice

+ Slide by slide: starting from the last sentence for the last slide
+ All slides: control speed and try to remember as much as possible

### Dry-run, prepare and answer questions, and take feedback

1. Have eye contact, be confident
1. That's good/interesting question. Give a high level overview of your answer in the beginning and then give the remaining details of your answer.
