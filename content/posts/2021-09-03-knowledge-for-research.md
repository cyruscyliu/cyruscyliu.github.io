# Knowledge for [System|Software] Security Research

In this post, I plan to update a list time by time about what we should know for
our research based on my experience.

For each course, if not pointed out, we can find videos for it on the internet.

## Programming Language and Tooling

+ Be familiar with C and Python.
+ Learn basic C++ and basic bash.
+ Learn Java for object-oriented programming.
+ Learn how to develop Dockerfile to make your artifact deployable everywhere.
+ Learn how to develop Json/Yaml to make your configs universal.

+ To compile C/C++, learn how to use gcc/g++/clang/clang++, how to install
and uninstall these compilers, and how to debug any warnings and errors.
+ Learn what is cross compilation and how to use relative compilers.
+ Learn everything about Python pip.

+ [Optional] Considering the memory safety issues of C/C++, learn memory safe
programming language, e.g., Rust.

## (Linux) utilities

+ ls/mv/pwd/cat/echo/mkdir/rm/touch
+ cd/pushd/popd
+ cp/rsync
+ vim
+ git

## Data Structure and Algorithm

+ Be familiar with Stack, Queue, Tree, and Graph.
+ Learn HashMap and Bitmap.
+ Learn automata and context-free grammar.
+ Learn temporal and spatial complexity.
