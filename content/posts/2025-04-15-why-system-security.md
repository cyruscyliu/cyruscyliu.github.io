# Why System Security?

System security is the practice to prevent computer systems from threats, such
as vulnerabilities and attacks, with safeguard technologies.

However, system security is too difficult to start, too complex to progress, and
too weak to survive.

Why are we doing system security? I believe it is because we are interested in
it. But, seriously, why are we still doing system security?

"Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest
mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? -JFK"

We choose system security as a profession and do related things not because they
are easy, but because they are hard, because when the wave of new technologies
cannot prove that they are secure, system security will always be there, that is
always the last line of defense and the base of trust.

That's cheerful. But we have issues.

- Department of AI science does not need us
- Venture capital does not favor us
- We hate each other

That's sad.

Always, I need to pursuade myself to stay, because it is hardly possible to get
a faculty position at the top universities, decent salary from companies, or
support from the community. (Sure, there are exceptions. Will it be you?)

Actions must be taken.

- We need to support each other (but be ethical).
- We need to tell a story that is relavant to others.
- We need to be faster to understand systems and implement our prototypes.

And confidence must be restored.
