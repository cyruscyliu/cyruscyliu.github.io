# Why system security?

System security is the practice to prevent computer systems from threats, such
as vulnerabilities and attacks, with safeguard technologies.

However, system security is too difficult to start, too complex to progress, and
too weak to survive.

Why are we doing this? I believe it is because we are interested in it. But,
seriously, why are we still doing system security?

"Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest
mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? -JFK"

We choose system security as a profession and do related things not because they
are easy, but because they are hard, because when the wave of new technologies
cannot prove that they are secure, system security will always be there, that is
always the last line of defense and the base of trust.

That's cheerful. But we have issues.

- Venture capital does not favor us
- Department of AI science does not need us
- This kind of research is generally hard

That's sad.

Always, I need to pursuade myself to stay, because it is hardly possible to get
decent salary from leading companies, or a faculty position at the top
universities.

Actions must be taken.

- We need to tell a story that is relevant to others
- We need to pretend to be interested in AI
- We need to change of way we do research, 1) seize the principle, 2) query the
  knowledge database, 3) do the implementation. Step 2 will make it quicker to
  understand the system, which is the most time-consuming part

And confidence must be restored.
