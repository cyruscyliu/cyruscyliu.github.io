# Research Presentation

Making <u>__c__</u>lear, <u>__e__</u>ngaging, and <u>__p__</u>ursuasive oral
representations is one of the keys to staying competitive, especially in front
of people who (most likely) do not share your values.

## Requirements

clear: focus, support, coherence

engaging: background, conection to the audience

pursuasive: catchy, trusted, desiring, safe, reasonable, pushing, evaluating

## Audience and Requirements

The first step of knowing your audience is to assume an edge case that no one
shares your values. All three requirements need to be satisfied. Second, adjust
the strategies based on how much background that your audience knows and how
much values that your audience shares with you.

### Make slides

[Susan McConnell (Stanford): Designing effective scientific
presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ): We are good
listeners and let's transfer the knowledge to make slides

- One slide, one topic sentence, 4-5 sentences, 1 minute
- Consider the attention curve
    * https://ethos3.com/hacking-the-audience-attention-curve/
    * Split into parts and summary the key message for each part
    * Write down the key messages and then fill up the rest
    * Highlight the key messages with both text and soundtrack
- A simple style
    * One font (Calibri)
    * Large font size (24, 28, 36, 52) and less text
    * Sentence in one line
    * Built-in list
    * Box for the key summary
    * Backup slides
- Animation
    * Too much text and show them one by one

### Practice

+ Per slide: start from the last sentence for the last slide
+ All slides: control speed and remember everything

### Dry-run, prepare and answer questions, and take feedback

- Have eye contact, be confident
- That's a good/interesting question/Let me rephrase your questions. Give a high
level overview of your answer in the beginning and then give the remaining
details of your answer.
