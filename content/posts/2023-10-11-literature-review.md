# Where to find related works?

# I don't know any related work

That's impossible.

## I know one related work and would like to find more

Find other papers that this related work cites or papers that cite this related
work. For any other paper, repeat the process until we find all related ones.

## I have a full list of related works

I prefer to reflect historically and logically on the relevant research so that
our paper can be seen as part of the historical and logical development of the
technology.

## There are just too many papers

For daily reading, I plan to focus on the security big-4s as I guess there are
1,000+ papers/year accepted by them when I am writing this post, apprantly more
including Sys/SE/PL/Arch conferences. Additionally, I have to narrow down the
topics I should follow. Just no one can know every paper.
