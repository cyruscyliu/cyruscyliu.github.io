# Daily Reading and Literature Review/Related Work

## Conferences and Topics

For daily reading, I plan to focus on the security big-4s as I guess there are
1,000+ papers/year accepted by them when I am writing this post, apprantly more
including Sys/SE/PL/Arch confs. Additionally, I have to narrow down the topics
I should follow. Just no one can know every paper.

## Searching Keywords (To be updated)

To write a literature reivew and a section of related work, these keywords help
me to find a complete set of papers related to what I'm doing.
