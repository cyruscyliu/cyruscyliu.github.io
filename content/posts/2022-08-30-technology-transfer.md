# Technology Transfer and Practices Under Control

Technology transfer is part of our research and will give feedback to our
research. Theoretical analysis will be omitted here. In practice, (but I still
want to limit the scope to system and software security), real impact of our
research is one of the strong criteria to get our papers accepted and our
proposals funded. At the same time, any ways of technology transfer (technology
transfer does not mean we have to own a start-up) will show us if our research
is better enough to solve real problems. Besides some practical experiences,
administrations and enterprises want technology transfer as well due to many
reasons. I think involving the technology transfer to be one part of our
research is a good idea, but we have to be careful.

## Open Source Software and Their Commercialization 

Suppose I have open-sourced a tool named OpenToy to support some security
analysis. When I am writing this article, OpenToy is not very mature. I want to
make this as an example and see how we can commercialize it. In the following, I
will list the ways of commercialization and compare them. Hopefully, we can see
a more and more mature OpenToy to be transferred.
