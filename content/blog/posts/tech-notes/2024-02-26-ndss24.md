## Session 1A: Firmware

+ Decentralized Information-Flow Control for ROS2
    - We present Picaros, a decentralized information-flow control (DIFC) system
        tailored for ROS2.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/decentralized-information-flow-control-for-ros2/)

+ Facilitating Non-Intrusive In-Vivo Firmware Testing with Stateless Instrumentation
    - Firmware fuzzing.
    - We develop a decoupled firmware testing framework named IPEA, which shifts
        the overhead of resource-intensive analysis tasks from the
        microcontroller to the workstation.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-116-paper.pdf)
    - Comments: requires source-code.

+ LDR: Secure and Efficient Linux Driver Runtime for Embedded TEE Systems
    - Zhen Ling
    - Sandboxing Linux kernel drivers.
    - In this paper, we propose a TEE driver execution environment—Linux driver
        runtime (LDR). The LDR reuses the existing TEE OS library functions
        whenever possible and redirects the kernel subsystem function calls to
        the Linux kernel in the normal world.

## Session 2A: Fuzz-all-the-things

+ REQSMINER: Automated Discovery of CDN Forwarding Request Inconsistencies and DoS Attacks with Grammar-based Fuzzing
    - Haixin Duan and [Jianjun Chen](https://www.jianjunchen.com/)
    - Network security.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-31-paper.pdf)

+ Large Language Model guided Protocol Fuzzing
    - Marcel Bohme and Abhik Roychoudhury
    - Protocol fuzzing.
    - We have developed an LLM-guided protocol implementation fuzzing engine.
        Our protocol fuzzer CHATAFL constructs grammars for each message type in
        a protocol, and then mutates messages or predicts the next messages in a
        message sequence via interactions with LLMs.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-556-paper.pdf)
    - Comments: Compares to AFLNet, NSFuzz aganist targets in ProFuzzBench.
        CHATAFL covers 47.60% and 42.69% more state transitions, 29.55% and 25.75%
        more states, but only 5.81% and 6.74% more code, respectively. Apart from
        enhanced coverage, CHATAFL discovered nine distinct and previously unknown
        vulnerabilities on the latest ProFuzzBench targets.
    - Comments: No new insight is proposed but the usage of LLM.
    - Comments: LLM stops us from thinking deeply.

+ SHAPFUZZ: Efficient Fuzzing via Shapley-Guided Byte Selection
    - [Xiao Xi](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xx_en/main.htm)
    - New approach to prioritize input bytes during fuzzing.
    - Some byte positions contribute more than others and this property often
        holds across different seeds. We propose a novel solution, called
        SHAPFUZZ, to guide byte selection and mutation in fuzzing processes.
        Specifically, SHAPFUZZ updates Shapley values (importance) of bytes when
        each input is tested during fuzzing with a low overhead. It utilizes
        contextual multiarmed bandit algorithm to make a trade off between
        mutating high Shapley value bytes and low-frequently chosen bytes.

## Session 4A: Leaks (Side-Channel Attacks)

+ Acoustic Keystroke Leakage on Smart Televisions
    - This work develops and demonstrates a new side-channel attack that exposes
        keystrokes from the audio of two popular Smart TVs: Apple and Samsung.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-72-paper.pdf)

+ IdleLeak: Exploiting Idle State Side Effects for Information Leakage 
    - [Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/)
    - Specifically, we exploit the processor idle state C0.2 to monitor system
        activity and for novel means of data exfiltration, and the idle state
        C0.1 to monitor system activity on logical sibling cores. 
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-78-paper.pdf)

+ TEE-SHirT: Scalable Leakage-Free Cache Hierarchies for TEEs
    - [Yu David Liu](https://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl/)
    - Efficient and correct partitioning requires careful design. Towards this
        goal, TEE-SHirT makes three contributions: 1) we demonstrate how the
        hardware structures used for holding cache partitioning metadata can be
        effectively virtualized to avoid flushing of cache partition content on
        context switches and system calls; 2) we show how to support
        multi-threaded enclaves in TEESHirT, addressing the issues of coherency
        and consistency that arise with both intra-core and inter-core data
        sharing; 3) we develop a formal security model for TEE-SHirT to
        rigorously reason about the security of our design.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-390-paper.pdf)

+ Exploiting Sequence Number Leakage: TCP Hijacking in NAT-Enabled Wi-Fi Networks
    - Network security.
    - In this paper, we uncover a new side-channel vulnerability in the widely
        used NAT port preservation strategy and an insufficient reverse path
        validation strategy of Wi-Fi routers, which allows an off-path attacker
        to infer if there is one victim client in the same network communicating
        with another host on the Internet using TCP.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-419-paper.pdf)

## Session 5A: Trusted Execution Environments

+ SENSE: Enhancing Microarchitectural Awareness for TEEs via Subscription-Based Notification
    - We propose SENSE, a solution that actively exposes underlying
        microarchitectural information to userspace TEEs. SENSE enables
        userspace software in TEEs to subscribe to fine-grained
        microarchitectural events and utilize the events as a means to
        contextualize the ongoing microarchitectural states. We initially
        demonstrate SENSE’s capability by applying it to defeat the
        state-of-the-art cache-based side-channel attacks. 
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-program/symposium-2024/)

+ EnclaveFuzz: Finding Vulnerabilities in SGX Applications
    - Chao Zhang
    - Vulnerability detection of TEE.
    - In this paper, we propose EnclaveFuzz, a multi-dimension structure-aware
        fuzzing framework that analyzes enclave sources to extract input
        structures and correlations, then generates fuzz harnesses that can
        produce valid inputs to pass sanity checks.  To conduct
        multi-dimensional fuzzing, EnclaveFuzz creates data for all three input
        dimensions of an enclave, including both parameters and return values
        that enter an enclave, as well as direct untrusted memory access from
        within an enclave. To detect more types of vulnerabilities, we design a
        new sanitizer to detect both SGX-specific vulnerabilities and typical
        memory corruption vulnerabilities. Lastly, we provide a custom SDK to
        accelerate the fuzzing process and execute the enclave without the need
        for special hardware.

+ Faults in Our Bus: Novel Bus Fault Attack to Break ARM TrustZone
    - [Debdeep Mukhopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/view/debdeepmukhopadhyay/home)
    - Fault injection.
    - In this work, we present the first practical implications of targeting an
        orthogonal aspect of SoC’s architecture: the system bus. We inject
        electromagnetic pulses onto the system bus during the execution of
        instructions involving processor-memory interaction. We show how address
        bus faults compromise software implementations of masked implementations
        of ciphers, illustrated using implementations of state-of-theart
        post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes, leaking entire secret keys with
        a single fault. We also demonstrate that data bus faults can be
        controlled and exploited to launch Differential Fault Analysis (DFA)
        attacks on table-based implementation of the Advanced Encryption
        Standard (AES).  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the impact of such bus
        faults can be farreaching and mislead the security guarantees of the
        popular and widely used ARM TrustZone.

## Session 6B: Exploitation

+ UntrustIDE: Exploiting Weaknesses in VS Code Extensions
    - SoK of VS code extensions.
    - This paper seeks to systematically understand the landscape of
        vulnerabilities in VS Code’s extension marketplace. We identify a set of
        four sources of untrusted input and three code targets that can be used
        for code injection and file integrity attacks and use them to design
        taint analysis rules in CodeQL. We then perform an ecosystemlevel
        analysis of the VS Code extension marketplace, studying 25,402
        extensions that contain code. Our results show that while
        vulnerabilities are not pervasive, they exist and impact millions of
        users. Specifically, we find 21 extensions with verified proof of
        concept exploits of code injection attacks impacting a total of over 6
        million installations.

+ SyzBridge: Bridging the Gap in Exploitability Assessment of Linux Kernel Bugs in the Linux Ecosystem
    - Zhiyun Qian
    - Post-fuzzing and vulnerability assessment.
    - We developed SyzBridge, a fully automated system that adapts upstream PoCs
        to downstream kernels. 
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/syzbridge-bridging-the-gap-in-exploitability-assessment-of-linux-kernel-bugs-in-the-linux-ecosystem/)

+ File Hijacking Vulnerability: The Elephant in the Room
    - SoK and detection of file hijacking vulnerabilities.
    - We developed a dynamic analysis tool, JERRY, which effectively detects
        FHVulns at runtime by simulating hijacking actions during program
        execution.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-38-paper.pdf)

+ Phoenix: Surviving Unpatched Vulnerabilities via Accurate and Efficient Filtering of Syscall Sequences
    - Provanence.
    - We propose Phoenix, a solution for preventing exploits of unpatched
        vulnerabilities by accurately and efficiently filtering sequences of
        system calls identified through provenance analysis.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-582-paper.pdf)


## Session 9A: Fuzz-more-things!

+ DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing
    - NUDT
    - AI for fuzzing.
    - In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed greybox fuzzer
        that can combine historical and predicted information to steer DGF to
        reach the target site via an optimal pat
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-514-paper.pdf)

+ MOCK: Optimizing Kernel Fuzzing Mutation with Context-aware Dependency
    - Shouling Ji
    - AI for kernel fuzzing.
    - In this paper, we present a practical and effective kernel
        fuzzing framework, called MOCK, which is capable of learning the
        contextual dependencies in syscall sequences and then generating
        context-aware syscall sequences
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-131-paper.pdf)

+ Predictive Context-sensitive Fuzzing
    - VUSec
    - In this paper, we show that a much more effective approach
        to context-sensitive fuzzing is possible. First, we propose function
        cloning as a backward-compatible instrumentation primitive to enable
        precise (i.e., collision-free) context-sensitive coverage tracking.
        Then, to tame the state explosion problem, we argue to account for
        contextual information only when a fuzzer explores contexts selected as
        promising. We propose a prediction scheme to identify one pool of such
        contexts: we analyze the data-flow diversity of the incoming argument
        values at call sites, exposing to the fuzzer a contextually refined
        clone of the callee if the latter sees incoming abstract objects that
        its uses at other sites do not.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/ndss2024_f113_paper.pdf)
    - Comments: calling-context -> hash -> collision -> function cloning (For
        instance, if contextual information is represented only by the caller of a
        function, the analysis may produce separate results for the unique clones of
        the callee devised for each possible caller.)

## Session 11B: Reverse Engineering

+ SIGMADIFF: Semantics-Aware Deep Graph Matching for Pseudocode Diffing
    - Heng Yin
    - AI for diffing.
    - To address the limitations, in this paper, we propose a semantics-aware,
        deep neural network-based model called SIGMADIFF for pseudocode diffing.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-208-paper.pdf)

+ DeGPT: Optimizing Decompiler Output with LLM
    - Kai Chen
    - AI for decompilation.
    - [paper](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-401-paper.pdf)

+ DYNPRE: Protocol Reverse Engineering via Dynamic Inference
    - Yu Jiang
    - Protocol/model inference.
    - This paper introduces DYNPRE, a protocol reverse engineering tool that
        exploits the interactive capabilities of protocol servers to obtain more
        semantic information and additional traffic for dynamic inference. This
        paper presents DYNPRE, a network trace based protocol reverse
        engineering tool that introduces dynamic inference for more accurate
        analysis. Unlike traditional methods that require high-quality static
        network traces for comprehensive statistical analysis, DYNPRE
        establishes active communication with the server using carefully
        constructed probe messages to extract insightful information and acquire
        additional samples as needed, making it well-suited for input traces
        with limited information.

    - UNIST

      a way that the distribution of heap chunks becomes more friendly to such
      workloads. A
