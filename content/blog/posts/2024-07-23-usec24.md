# Usenix Security 24

Notes, 1) x/x/x follows a format of "# of Chinese first authors who study in
China"/"# of Chinese first authors who study abroad"/"# of submissions", 2) x/x
follows a format of "# of Chinese first authors"/"# of submissions".

Chinese first authors are good at (>=50% of submissions) hardware security,
system security, network security, security analysis, mobile security, fuzzing,
IoT and CPS, Autonomous and Automatic Systems, AR and VR, ML, LLM, block chain,
and differential privacy.

Not good at side channel, web security, user studies, cyrpto, cyrptographic
protocols, social issues, zero-knowledge proof, and some other small topics.
