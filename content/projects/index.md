-   :material-pill:{ .lg .middle } __Hypervisor Security__

    ---

    With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of AI, cloud computing is
    experiencing renewed momentum. At the core of secure cloud infrastructure
    lies a vulnerability-free hypervisor. Embracing a full-lifecycle security
    approach, our research focuses on identifying and resolving hypervisor
    vulnerabilities prior to release, while also developing complementary
    defenses to mitigate attacks in production environments. To drive deeper
    insights, we also develop real-world exploits targeting state-of-the-art
    hypervisors.

    ---

    The success of AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack,
    from hardware to high-level software. As new codebases and specialized
    hardware emerge to support AI workloads, longstanding security challenges
    are resurfacing in modern contexts. Our research investigates security
    issues across multiple layers of AI systems, focusing on data, models,
    compilers, interpreters, operating systems, hypervisors, and heterogeneous
    hardware such as GPUs.

    ---

    <!-- The evolution of computing has progressed through several transformative
    milestonesâ€”from standalone systems to personal computing and the Web 2.0 era,
    followed by large-scale computing and deep learning, and more recently, the rise
    of foundation models and AI breakthroughs. -->
    As we move into the next era defined by ubiquitous computing and
    heterogeneous system architectures, security challenges are becoming more
    complex and distributed.
    <!-- In this new landscape, computing devices take many
    forms: personal, enterprise-grade, and embedded systems, all interconnected
    through a global edge fabric.-->
    The scale and diversity of these environments
    demand a unified software ecosystem and robust, adaptable security
    frameworks. Crucially, the security paradigm must shift: success is no
    longer measured solely by the ability to block attacks. Instead, the focus
    must be on resilience, ensuring rapid recovery, minimizing downtime, and
    maintaining business continuity after incidents.
    <!-- We propose a thin, scalable, and formally verified minimum recovery
    system as a foundational layer to meet this challenge, enabling reliable,
    system-wide restoration in the face of growing threats. -->
