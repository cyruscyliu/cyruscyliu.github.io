## About me

Hi, I am Qiang Liu, currently a postdoc at EPFL under the guidance of [Prof.
Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/). I obtained my Ph.D. in cybersecurity at
Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/). Prior to ZJU, I earned my bachelor's degree at
Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2018.  We have published a few papers
at all four top-tier security conferences, IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and NDSS.  To
engage the community, we always open-source our tools and evaluation scripts.

I am always thinking outside the box when it comes to cybersecurity's
cat-and-mouse game. It started with Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity
competition, where I learned to break systems, e.g., reverse engineering binaries
and developing exploits, and be a team player. Over the years, collaborating
with my colleagues, we have developed new approaches to protect systems from
attacks. Specifically, we have proposed advanced fuzz testing techniques to
unveil vulnerabilities in OS kernels and hypervisors before this infrastructure
software is released.  I am interested in the infrastructure software, such as
OS kernels and hypervisors, because they are used everywhere to establish
security trust for the upper layers. These systems must be flawless, as any
error could significantly impact not only individuals but also organizations.
Their reliability is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning of both
personal and professional activities in daily life. All in all, my research
focuses on making infrastructure software, such as OS kernels and hypervisors,
protocols and browsers as well, bug and exploitation-free through innovative
designs in both hardware and software.

I've also gotten better at managing multiple projects
smoothly, communicating with people well, and making the team deliver results.

We're open to discussing and collaborating on any of the following active
projects. Feel free to reach out via this long-term email address:

## Awards

+ [HyperPill](./papers/hyperpill-sec24.pdf) wins USENIX Security'24 Best Paper Award

## Projects and Publications

### Hypervisor Fuzzing

+ [ViDeZZo](./papers/videzzo-sp23.pdf) (IEEE SP'23) first summarized the intra-
and inter-message dependencies required for fuzzing virtual devices. ViDeZZo is
[open-source](https://github.com/HexHive/videzzo) and it can fuzz
QEMU/VirtualBox virtual devices in a scalable and efficient way. 28 new bugs
have been reported.

+ [ViDeZZo LLVM Project](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/videzzo-llvm-project),
forked from LLVM Project 13, contains the compiler/libFuzzer we use to compile
QEMU/VirtualBox virtual devices.

+ [buildroot-external-packages](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/buildroot-external-packages)
provides templates of userspace programs and kernel modules to reproduce virtual
device bugs and develop exploits.

+ [HyperPill](./papers/hyperpill-sec24.pdf) (USENIX Security'24) first leveraged
hardware virtualization interface to fuzz arbitrary hypervisors. We evaluated
HyperPill with QEMU, Hyper-V, and macOS Virtualization Framework. 26 new bugs
have been reported.

### Network Protocol Fuzzing

+ Development of Peach Pits for layer 3 network protocols. As an intern, I
developed several Peach Pits by reading the specifications of specific network
protocols.

+ [Tango](./papers/tango-raid24.pdf) (RAID'24) first abstracted state feedback
from edge coverage feedback. Tango is
[open-source](https://github.com/HexHive/tango) and it can fuzz stateful
targets, i.e., 1) protocol targets: bftpd, dcmtk, dnsmasq, tinydtls, exim,
lightftp, openssh, openssl, proftpd, pureftpd, live555, and kamailio, 2)
parsers: expat, llhttp, and yaml. (forked-daap is not supported.)

### Embedded System Rehosting (Archived)

This project rehosts embedded Linux kernels for routers, cameras, and other
high-end devices with QEMU. Then, we can dynamically analyze rootkits or
vulnerabilities in the embedded Linux kernels and create honeypots at scale.
Relative research papers are [FirmGuide (ASE'21,
co-first-authors)](./papers/firmguide-ase21.pdf), and [ECMO (CCS'21, 4th
author)](./papers/ecmo-ccs21.pdf).

We open source the following projects.

+ [pyqemulog](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/pyqemulog) is the qemu-log ported to
Python. It converts the structured trace generated by QEMU with -d to JSON.

+ [llbic](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/llbic), which is short for LLVM Linux
Build Issues Collection, helps compile old Linux kernels in LLVM bitcode. It
replaces GCC to clang and adjusts other flags in the make command lines to
generate bitcode files, and then links them all together to a `vmlinux.bc`.

+ [openwrt-build-docker](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/openwrt-build-docker)
supports automatically building the OpenWrt project given a target/subtarget of
a specific OpenWrt revision from 10.03 to 19.07.1.

+ [FirmGuide](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/firmguide) can help you to develop a
QEMU virtual machine for a Linux-based embedded system, especially boosting the
capability of dynamic analysis of the corresponding Linux kernel. In the
emulator, you can debug, trace, and test the Linux kernel to collect runtime
information that can be used to understand vulnerabilities, PoCs, root causes of
crashes in the Linux kernel. FirmGuide is an effectively complementary to
Firmadyne that focuses on user space programs - FirmGuide focuses on the Linux
kernel.

+ [ECMO](https://github.com/valour01/ecmo) receives a firmware image, and it can
successfully re-host the Linux kernel inside the image to get the shell.  Due to
the variety of peripherals in embedded firmware images. It is rather hard to
build a general emulator that supports all kinds of machines. The basic idea of
ECMO is to transplant the peripherals by support ones into the target Linux
kernel, hence solve the problem of peripheral variety.


### Android Authentication (Archived)

This project evaluates existing and proposes new implicit continuous
authentication approaches to serve as a second authentication factor longside
fingerprint and facial identification. I joined this project as an intern and
then proposed this project to be my final project for my Bachelor's degree.
Relative research papers are [RiskCog (TMC'20)](./papers/riskcog-tmc20.pdf),
[ESPIALCOG (TMC'20)(5th author)](./papers/espialcog-tmc20.pdf), [One Cycle
Attack (TIFS'20) (3rd author)](./papers/one-cycle-attack-tifs20.pdf), and
[TRAPCOG (TMC'23) (3rd author)](./papers/trapcog-tmc23.pdf).
