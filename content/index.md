Hi, I am Qiang Liu, currently a postdoc at EPFL, collaborating with the talented
people at [HexHive](https://hexhive.epfl.ch/) under the guidance of [Prof.
Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/). I obtained my Ph.D. in cybersecurity at
Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/). Prior to ZJU, I earned my bachelor's degree at
Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT).

I'm always thinking outside the box when it comes to cybersecurity's
cat-and-mouse game. It started with CTF competitions, where I learned to break
systems and work with teams. Over the years, collaborating with experts, I've
developed new approaches to protect systems from attacks. Along the way, I've
also gotten better at managing multiple projects smoothly and keeping the team
engaged.

Specifically, my research focuses on system and software security. I have broad
interests in attacks and defenses covering different areas, namely
virtualization, operating systems, browsers, and protocols. We have published a
few papers at top-tier security conferences like IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, and
CCS. To engage the community, we always open-source our tools and evaluation
scripts.

Besides research, I'm also interested in badminton, hiking, biking, and road
trips. Feel free to contact me via this long-term email address:

## Projects and Publications

We're open to discussing and collaborating on any of the following active
projects. Feel free to reach out.

### Hypervisor Fuzzing

This project tries to discover vulnerabilities in both open-source and
closed-source hypervisors, covering virtual devices, VM management, and CPU
emulation, and to fix them as early as possible. Relative research papers are
[ViDeZZo (1st author)](./papers/videzzo-sp23.pdf) and [HyperPill (2nd
author)](./papers/hyperpill-sec24.pdf).

We open source the following projects.

+ [ViDeZZo](https://github.com/HexHive/videzzo) can fuzz QEMU/VirtualBox virtual
devices in a scalable and efficient way. (Author and Maintainer)

+ [ViDeZZo LLVM Project](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/videzzo-llvm-project),
forked from LLVM Project 13, contains the compiler/libFuzzer we use to compile
QEMU/VirtualBox virtual devices. (Author and Maintainer)

+ [buildroot-external-packages](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/buildroot-external-packages)
provides a template for your own userspace programs and kernel modules into a
Buildroot kernel. I've been using this a lot to reproduce QEMU bugs. (Author and Maintainer)

### Network Protocol Fuzzing

This project tries to fuzz network protocols, especially router protocols. I
joined this project as an intern and wrote several Peach Pits by 1) learning the
grammar of Peach Pit, 2) understanding specific network protocols via their
specifications, 3) collaborating with others to deploy our Peach Pits.

### Embedded System Rehosting (Archived)

This project rehosts embedded Linux kernels for routers, cameras, and other
high-end devices with QEMU. Then, we can dynamically analyze rootkits or
vulnerabilities in the embedded Linux kernels and create honeypots at scale.
Relative research papers are [FirmGuide (ASE'21,
co-first-authors)](./papers/firmguide-ase21.pdf), and [ECMO (CCS'21, 4th
author)](./papers/ecmo-ccs21.pdf).

We open source the following projects.

+ [pyqemulog](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/pyqemulog) is the qemu-log ported to
Python. It converts the structured trace generated by QEMU with -d to JSON.
(Author and Maintainer)

+ [llbic](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/llbic), which is short for LLVM Linux
Build Issues Collection, helps compile old Linux kernels in LLVM bitcode. It
replaces GCC to clang and adjusts other flags in the make command lines to
generate bitcode files, and then links them all together to a `vmlinux.bc`.
(Co-authors and Maintainer)

+ [openwrt-build-docker](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/openwrt-build-docker)
supports automatically building the OpenWrt project given a target/subtarget of
a specific OpenWrt revision from 10.03 to 19.07.1. (Co-author and Maintainer)

+ [FirmGuide](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/firmguide) can help you to develop a
QEMU virtual machine for a Linux-based embedded system, especially boosting the
capability of dynamic analysis of the corresponding Linux kernel. In the
emulator, you can debug, trace, and test the Linux kernel to collect runtime
information that can be used to understand vulnerabilities, PoCs, root causes of
crashes in the Linux kernel. FirmGuide is an effectively complementary to
Firmadyne that focuses on user space programs - FirmGuide focuses on the Linux
kernel. (Co-author and Maintainer)

+ [ECMO](https://github.com/valour01/ecmo) receives a firmware image, and it can
successfully re-host the Linux kernel inside the image to get the shell.  Due to
the variety of peripherals in embedded firmware images. It is rather hard to
build a general emulator that supports all kinds of machines. The basic idea of
ECMO is to transplant the peripherals by support ones into the target Linux
kernel, hence solve the problem of peripheral variety.


### Android Authentication (Archived)

This project evaluates existing and proposes new implicit continuous
authentication approaches to serve as a second authentication factor longside
fingerprint and facial identification. I joined this project as an intern and
then proposed this project to be my final project for my Bachelor's degree.
Relative research papers are [RiskCog (TMC'20)](./papers/riskcog-tmc20.pdf),
[ESPIALCOG (TMC'20)(5th author)](./papers/espialcog-tmc20.pdf), [One Cycle
Attack (TIFS'20) (3rd author)](./papers/one-cycle-attack-tifs20.pdf), and
[TRAPCOG (TMC'23) (3rd author)](./papers/trapcog-tmc23.pdf).
