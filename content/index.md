[**whoami**] Qiang Liu is a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL, working with [Prof.
Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the HexHive laboratory. He earned his
Ph.D. in 2023 from Zhejiang University under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/) and a B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of
Technology (BIT) in 2018. His research in cybersecurity focuses on developing
full-lifecycle security enforcement of systems, including ahead-of-release bug
finding and in-production attack mitigation. His work has been recognized at all
top security conferences: IEEE SSP, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He
received the Best Paper Awards at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also
serving on the program committee for USENIX Security'25 and is a reviewer for
ACM CSUR and ACM TOSEM.

[**history**] Qiang Liu's journey began with a Capture the Flag (CTF)
competition, where he learned techniques like reverse engineering and
exploitation. During his PhD and PostDoc, Qiang Liu pioneered innovative
solutions, including auto-extracted input dependencies and a generic executor,
to significantly strengthen hypervisor security. These breakthroughs led to the
discovery and mitigation of nearly 100 hypervisor vulnerabilities prior to
software release.

## Research and Tools 

[**interpreter security**]

+ Reflecta, [paper](./papers/reflecta-asiaccs25.pdf), **AsiaCCS'25**,
leveraging reflection to fuzz arbitry interpreters! (focusing on the libraries)

[**hypervisor security**]

Hardening hypervisors need quality input and generic executors.

Regarding quality input, [ViDeZZo](https://github.com/HexHive/videzzo)
([paper](./papers/videzzo-sp23.pdf), **IEEE SSP'23**) first proposed intra- and
inter-message dependencies, and then [Truman](https://github.com/vul337/Truman)
([paper](./papers/truman-ndss25.pdf),
**ISOC NDSS'25**) highlighted state-dependency. Truman further explained how to
auto-extract intra-/inter-message, and state dependencies from the Linux kernel
via static analysis.

Regarding generic executors,
[HyperPill](https://github.com/HexHive/HyperPill/tree/artifact-evaluation)
([paper](./papers/hyperpill-sec24.pdf), **USENIX Security'24**, Best Paper
Award) first propose a snapshot-based hypervisor dock, capable of running both
open-source and closed-source and both x86 and aarch64 hypervisors.

+ [ViDeZZo LLVM Project](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/videzzo-llvm-project)
forked from LLVM Project 13, instrumentation and libFuzzer for ViDeZZo
+ [buildroot-external-packages](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/buildroot-external-packages)
and [virtfuzz-bugs](https://github.com/HexHive/virtfuzz-bugs), PoC

[**network protocol fuzzing**]

+ [Tango](https://github.com/HexHive/tango), [paper](./papers/tango-raid24.pdf),
**ACM RAID'24** (Best Paper), abstract state feedback from edge coverage
feedback, supporting targets in ProFuzzBench (except forked-daap).
+ Development of Peach Pits for layer 3 network protocols. As an intern, I
developed several Peach Pits by reading the specifications of specific network
protocols.

[**firmware rehosting**]

+ [ECMO](https://github.com/valour01/ecmo) (**CCS'21**) takes a firmware image
as input, and it can successfully rehost the Linux kernel inside the image to
get the shell. Due to the variety of peripherals in embedded firmware images,
it is rather hard to build a general emulator that supports all kinds of
machines. The basic idea of ECMO is to transplant the peripherals by support
ones into the target Linux kernel, hence solve the problem of peripheral
variety.
+ [FirmGuide](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/firmguide) (**ASE'21**) creates a
QEMU virtual machine for a Linux-based embedded system, especially boosting the
capability of dynamic analysis of the corresponding Linux kernel. In the
emulator, you can debug, trace, and test the Linux kernel to collect runtime
information to understand vulnerabilities, PoCs, root causes of
crashes in the Linux kernel. FirmGuide is an effectively complementary to
Firmadyne that focuses on user space programs - FirmGuide focuses on the Linux
kernel.
+ [pyqemulog](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/pyqemulog) is the qemu-log ported to
Python. It converts the structured trace generated by QEMU with -d to JSON.
+ [llbic](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/llbic), short for LLVM Linux
Build Issues Collection, compiles old Linux kernels in LLVM bitcode. It
replaces GCC to clang and adjusts cflags in the command lines to
generate bitcode files, and then links them all together to a `vmlinux.bc`.
+ [openwrt-build-docker](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/openwrt-build-docker)
supports automatically building the OpenWrt project given a target/subtarget of
a specific OpenWrt revision from 10.03 to 19.07.1.

[**android authentication (archived)**]

This project evaluates existing and proposes new implicit continuous
authentication approaches to serve as a second authentication factor alongside
fingerprint and facial identification. I joined this project as an intern and
then proposed part of it as my final project for my bachelor's degree. Relative
research papers are [RiskCog (TMC'20)](./papers/riskcog-tmc20.pdf), [ESPIALCOG
(TMC'20)](./papers/espialcog-tmc20.pdf), [One Cycle Attack
(TIFS'20)](./papers/one-cycle-attack-tifs20.pdf), and [TRAPCOG
(TMC'23))](./papers/trapcog-tmc23.pdf).
