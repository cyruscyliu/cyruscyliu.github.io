## Bio and Contacts [:material-email:](mailto:cyruscyliu@gmail.com) [:fontawesome-brands-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiangliu15/) [:simple-wechat:](weixin://dl/chat?ocat01)

Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with [Prof. Mathias
Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the HexHive laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in
2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/) and a B.S. degree from the Beijing Institute of
Technology (BIT) in 2018. His research in cybersecurity focuses on 1) developing
prior-to/after-release security enforcement of software based on deep
understanding, and 2) building the chain of trust examined by full-chain
exploits. His work has been recognized at all top security conferences: IEEE
S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He received the Best Paper Awards
at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also serving on the program
committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and is a reviewer for ACM
CSUR and ACM TOSEM. See his [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) and [Google
