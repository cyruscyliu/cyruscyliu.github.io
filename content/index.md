## Introduction

Hi, my name is Qiang Liu. I am currently a PhD candidate at the College of
Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China. I
visited HEXHIVE at EPFL from 2021.08 to 2022.03. My research interests include
system and software security. It is welcome to contact me by email at
cyruscyliu@gmail.com.

## Projects, Publications, and Real Impact

### 0x02 Embedded System Rehosting

This project tries to rehost embedded Linux kernels for routers, cameras, and
other high-end devices. Then, we can dynamically analyze bugs or
vulnerabilities, detect bugs or vulnerabilities, make honey pots, detect and
inspect malware. Relative research papers are [FirmGuide (ASE'21,
co-first-authors)](./papers/firmguide-ase21.pdf), and [ECMO (CCS'21, 4th
author)](./papers/ecmo-ccs21.pdf).

We open source the following projects.

+ [pyqemulog](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/pyqemulog) is the qemu-log ported to
Python. It converts the structured trace generated by QEMU with -d to JSON.
(Author and Maintainer)

+ [llbic](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/llbic), which is short for LLVM Linux
Build Issues Collection, helps compile old Linux kernels in LLVM bitcode. It
replaces GCC to clang and adjusts other flags in the make command lines to
generate bitcode files, and then links them all together to a `vmlinux.bc`.
(Co-authors and Maintainer)

+ [openwrt-build-docker](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/openwrt-build-docker)
supports automatically building the OpenWrt project given a target/subtarget of
a specific OpenWrt revision from 10.03 to 19.07.1. (Co-author and Maintainer)

+ [FirmGuide](https://github.com/cyruscyliu/firmguide) can help you to develop a
QEMU virtual machine for a Linux-based embedded system, especially boosting the
capability of dynamic analysis of the corresponding Linux kernel. In the
emulator, you can debug, trace, and test the Linux kernel to collect runtime
information that can be used to understand vulnerabilities, PoCs, root causes of
crashes in the Linux kernel. FirmGuide is an effectively complementary to
Firmadyne that focuses on user space programs - FirmGuide focuses on the Linux
kernel. (Co-author and Maintainer)

+ [ECMO](https://github.com/valour01/ecmo) receives a firmware image, and it can
successfully re-host the Linux kernel inside the image to get the shell.  Due to
the variety of peripherals in embedded firmware images. It is rather hard to
build a general emulator that supports all kinds of machines. The basic idea of
ECMO is to transplant the peripherals by support ones into the target Linux
kernel, hence solve the problem of peripheral variety. (Maintainer)

### 0x01 Android Authentication

This project tries to evaluate existing and propose new implicit continuous
authentication approaches. The implicit continuous authentication can be a
second authentication factor for fingerprint and face identification. I joined
this project as an intern and then proposed this project to be my final project
for my Bachelor's degree. Relative research papers are [RiskCog
(TMC'20)](./papers/riskcog-tmc20.pdf), [ESPIALCOG (TMC'20)(5th
author)](./papers/espialcog-tmc20.pdf), and [One Cycle Attack (TIFS'20) (3rd
author)](./papers/one-cycle-attack-tifs20.pdf).

### 0x00 Network Protocol Fuzzing (Archived)

This project tries to fuzz network protocols, especially router
protocols. I joined this project as an intern and wrote several Peach
Pits by 1) learning the grammar of Peach Pit, 2) understanding specific
network protocols via their specifications.
