Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with [Prof. Mathias
Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the HexHive laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in
2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/). His research in cybersecurity focuses on 1)
developing prior-to/after-release security enforcement of software based on deep
understanding, and 2) building the chain of trust examined by full-chain
exploits. See his [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) and [Google
