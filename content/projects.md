## Hacking Culture

systematically explore and celebrate hacking cultureâ€”not just to entertain
ourselves but also to inspire and attract more people to join us.  Parents can
raise children who are independent and creative, teachers can guides students
who are collaborative and competitive, and entrepreneurs can engage customers
who are eager to buy innovative products. Be classy and be cool!
