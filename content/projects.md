-   :material-pill:{ .lg .middle } __Hypervisor Security__

    ---

    With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of AI, cloud computing is
    experiencing renewed momentum. At the core of secure cloud infrastructure
    lies a vulnerability-free hypervisor. Embracing a full-lifecycle security
    approach, our research focuses on identifying and resolving hypervisor
    vulnerabilities prior to release, while also developing complementary
    defenses to mitigate attacks in production environments. To drive deeper
    insights, we also develop real-world exploits targeting state-of-the-art
    hypervisors.

-   :fontawesome-solid-computer:{ .lg .middle } __AI System Security__

    ---

    The success of AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack,
    from hardware to high-level software. As new codebases and specialized
    hardware emerge to support AI workloads, longstanding security challenges
    are resurfacing in modern contexts. Our research investigates security
    issues across multiple layers of AI systems, focusing on compilers,
    interpreters, operating systems, hypervisors, and heterogeneous hardware
    such as GPUs.

-   :material-dock-bottom:{ .lg .middle } __Security Shift: from Defense to Resilience__

    ---

    The evolution of computing has progressed through several transformative
    milestones—from standalone systems to personal computing and the Web 2.0 era,
    followed by large-scale computing and deep learning, and more recently, the rise
    of foundation models and AI breakthroughs. As we move into the next era—defined
    by ubiquitous computing and heterogeneous system architectures—security
    challenges are becoming more complex and distributed. In this new landscape,
    computing devices take many forms: personal, enterprise-grade, and embedded
    systems, all interconnected through a global edge fabric. The scale and
    diversity of these environments demand a unified software ecosystem and robust,
    adaptable security frameworks. Crucially, the security paradigm must shift:
    success is no longer measured solely by the ability to block attacks. Instead,
    the focus must be on resilience—ensuring rapid recovery, minimizing downtime,
    and maintaining business continuity after incidents. We propose a thin,
    scalable, and formally verified minimum recovery system as a foundational layer
    to meet this challenge, enabling reliable, system-wide restoration in the face
    of growing threats.

## Weekend Projects

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :art:{ .lg .middle } __Hacking Culture__

    We have focused too much on cool technology while neglecting the fun stories,
    nerdy fonts, and meme creativity that are equally important. It's time to
    systematically explore and celebrate hacking culture—not just to entertain
    ourselves but also to inspire and attract more people to join us.  Parents can
    raise children who are independent and creative, teachers can guides students
    who are collaborative and competitive, and entrepreneurs can engage customers
    who are eager to buy innovative products. Be classy and be cool!
