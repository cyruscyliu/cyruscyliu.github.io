<h1 id="a-summary-of-questions-in-research">A Summary of Questions in Research</h1>
<h2 id="where-to-find-a-problem">Where to find a problem</h2>
<p>Most practical ideas come from your research activities. Usually, we can read
and propose a new idea after reading a paper. However, there would be a huge
delay. First, a research paper would be published two years later. Second, even
some PC members can check all interesting papers submitted to a conference, but
there is about half a year or one-year delay. How can we fill the gap? No, we
cannot unless we are connecting or collaborating with them. Another source of
research ideas is real requirements from users. This source is so so inefficient
unless we are connecting or collaborating with industry people. What I argue
here is that most practical ideas come from our research activities, and we
should be curious about everything in our research activities all the time.  To
make it more clear, we can put it in this way. Everything can be studied.
Whenever you find or hear of a thing that can be studied, we should show our
interests and then clarify the motivation. BTW, do not forget our connection
with the academic and industrial community in which inevitable benefits will
come as well.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-define-problems">How to define problems</h2>
<p>Before going further, I’d like to discuss the types of knowledge. One type of
knowledge looks forward, and the other focuses on backward. Classifying research
ideas in computer science bridges computer science to other disciplines. Physics
looks forward, and history looks backward. We should also think in this way
during our research activities. Designing a system looks forward while reviewing
literature looks backward. Learning the history of all science helps to improve
our research quality in computer science. Here, we have the first category you
should judge for a thing to be studied: looking forward or looking backward.</p>
<p>A thing is an object to be studied. During our activities, we always do
something. It is obvious that we have to be curious about a thing that would be
our research object. An object can be a thing in the real world, for example, a
piece of software; an object can be a process of humanity, for example,
developing a piece of software. We can see similarities and differences between
them. Actually, we can always consider them both. Interestingly, if we focus on
a thing itself, the research problems would look forward; if we focus on a human
process, the research problems look backward. Here we have the second category:
a thing or a human process.</p>
<p>Define a looking-forward problem starting from essential while define a
looking-backward problem starting from history. To make our research more
scientific, we should get rid of some bad influence of construction problems
that usually make computer science (and technology) to computer engineering in
which all scientific parts are covered up. For a looking-forward problem, we
have to define what to predict, and for a looking-backward problem, you have to
define what to summarize. To go on developing an initial analysis of your
problem, it could be simpler if we follow logic. Here we have the third
category: essential and history.</p>
<p>BTW, check <a href="https://medium.com/digital-diplomacy/how-to-look-for-ideas-in-computer-science-research-7a3fa6f4696f">this
article</a>
to learn the patterns of research and other tips.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-evaluate-your-problems">How to evaluate your problems</h2>
<p>Now, we have two simple problems: what to predict and what to summarize. We have
to introduce more principles to evaluate our specific problems because not all
problems are worthy of study.</p>
<p>The first question would be if a problem is solvable. We have to seek help from
the computation theory and estimate what the best we can do. We should think
about the essentials of your problem, leverage some theoretical results, and
make an agreement on acceptable assumptions and challenges. After thinking of
our solutions, we have several ideas.</p>
<p>The second question would be if a problem is generic. We have to check in the
world whether this problem has many instances in the real world, in which the
real impact comes.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-evaluate-your-ideas">How to evaluate your ideas</h2>
<p>Remember that not all ideas can be published at top-tier conferences. One is the
novelty, and the other is superiority. To be novel, we have to do a literature
review and distinguish our idea from others’. Because of the time budget, we
cannot make our idea superior to others in every aspect, and thus we can choose
the core metrics. The core metrics evolve among the development of the whole
community. It is quite easy to understand. Some technology becomes mature such
that some metrics are easier to achieve. Such easier metrics are not core
metrics but the metrics you have to include. Consider all techniques you can use
to be superior.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-execute-an-idea">How to execute an idea</h2>
<p>Of course, we are not going to execute an idea. We are going to implement it. To
increase our acceptance rate, we are not supposed to make many mistakes.
Nowadays, the research community is competitive because not only most of the
problems are easier to solve, but also more and more people join us. When
reviewers judge a manuscript, they pick up your mistakes and reject the papers
that have more. Here are some tips from past research activities.</p>
<h3 id="budge-your-time">Budge your time</h3>
<ul>
<li>Considering where we are and what stage in our career, we have to make a goal.</li>
<li>Think and ask ourselves about what is the fastest way to do this and then do it.</li>
<li>Spend 30 seconds more to save us from a 30 mins disaster.</li>
<li>Have a rest in the evening and on weekends if we can focus more on weekdays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-our-system-and-our-evaluation">Design our system and our evaluation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish background, design, and implementation of our system.</li>
<li>Design our evaluation and don’t waste time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="well-write-our-paper-rather-than-a-sloppy-one">Well-write our paper rather than a sloppy one</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write our paper in advance and get feedback on structure from others</li>
<li>Keep learning to write a paper and revise, revise, and revise.</li>
</ul>
