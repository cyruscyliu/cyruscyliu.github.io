# Skills and Collaboration for Research Project Code

We always would like to see solid implementation along with a novel idea. To be
good at solid coding, we need specific skills and efficient collaboration
because of the time budget. Usually, we want to finish most of the research
projects within half a year or one year to catch up on three or four deadlines
of top-tier conferences.

## Specific Skills

The specific skills include three levels.

### Level 0

At the very beginning, we have to take the courses in the following.
+ Data Structure and Algorithm
+ Database
+ Network
+ Operating System
+ Architecture and Computation System

You are encouraged to take the following courses to go further.
+ Compiler
+ Computation Theory
+ Information Security

At the same time, you are encouraged to seize two or three programming
languages. Usually, they can be C/C++, Java, and Python. Usually, it is quite
helpful to know bash.

### Level 1

At this level, you have to train yourself through projects and be familiar with
what in the following.

First, you are supposed to know how to start, maintain and advertise a project.
Here are several topics for you.

+ Requirements Analysis
+ Code Style
+ Version Control: Pull, Documentation, Commit, Push or Pull Request
+ Discussion: Issue, Maillist, and Forum
+ Debug and Patch
+ Testing and Automation
+ Time/Risk Control
+ Package Manager: npm, pip, and README

Second, you are supposed to learn existing wheels and their details. For
example, you can learn how Flask and Django web servers work. After that, you
should know how to set up a minimum web server as quickly as possible. Here is a
summary.
+ Application: QT, Android
+ Web Server: Flask, Django
+ Operating System: Linux Kernel
+ Virtualization: QEMU
+ Message Queue: Kafka
+ Container: Docker

### Level 3

At this level, you have to learn how to design.
+ Modulars and Layers
+ Object-oriented Programming
+ Design Patterns
+ Refactoring

At the same time, you need to follow a set of generic principles when you are coding.
+ Use Dockerfile.
+ Share and reuse code.
+ Add an abstract layer when there is no abstraction.

### Level 4

At the level, develop your style for research project code. (TBC)
