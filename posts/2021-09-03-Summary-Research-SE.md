# Programming Skills for Research

We always would like to see solid implementation along with a novel idea. To be
good at solid coding, we need specific skills and efficient collaboration
because of the time budget. Usually, we want to finish most of the research
projects within half a year or one year to cover three or four deadlines of
top-tier conferences.

I group the following programming skills into four levels regarding my personal
experiences. At level 1, attend basic courses in computer science to get
familiar with theories and design decisions in computing systems. At level 2,
train ourselves about how to involve, develop, and maintain an open-source
project. At level 3, develop our coding style for research projects and make our
research reproducible, inspiring, and influential. At level 4, try existing
techniques, learn their design decisions, implementation, and maybe join their
community by sending patches.

## Level 1

At the very beginning, we have to take the courses in the following.
+ Data Structure and Algorithm
+ Database
+ Network
+ Operating System
+ Architecture and Computation System

You are encouraged to take the following courses to go further.
+ Compiler
+ Computation Theory
+ Information Security

At the same time, we are encouraged to seize two or three programming
languages. Usually, they can be C/C++, Java, and Python. Usually, it is quite
helpful to know shell commands.

## Level 2

At this level, we have to train ourselves through projects and be familiar with
what in the following.
+ Requirements Analysis
+ Code Style
+ Documentation
+ Version Control: Pull, Documentation, Commit, Push or Pull Request
+ Discussion: Issue, Maillist, and Forum
+ Debug and Patch
+ Testing and Automation
+ Time/Risk Control
+ Package Manager: npm, pip, and README

## Level 3

At this level, develop our style for research project code.
+ Build the smallest SDK with limited but enough unit tests
+ Build our applications on that SDK
+ Move commonly used code in the applications to the SDK
+ Don't do too much when developing the changing applications

## Level 4

At this level, we are supposed to learn existing wheels and their details. For
instance, we can learn how Flask and Django web servers work. After that, we
should know the design choices, their pros/cons, and how to set up a minimum web
quickly.

Think about some metrics.
+ CPU utilization
+ Cache optimization
+ Memory consumption
+ Disk consumption

Here is a summary of selected projects.
+ Application: QT, Android
+ Web Server: Flask, Django
+ Operating System: Linux Kernel
+ Virtualization: QEMU
+ Message Queue: Kafka
+ Container: Docker

**Summary** Develop quick and dirty code and improve your skills by learning
existing projects.
