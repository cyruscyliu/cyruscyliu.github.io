-   __Hypervisor Security__

    ---

-   __AI System Security__

    ---

    The success of AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack,
    from hardware to high-level software. As new codebases and specialized
    hardware emerge to support AI workloads, longstanding security challenges
    are resurfacing in modern contexts. Our research investigates security
    issues across multiple layers of AI systems, focusing on data, models, AI
    compilers, operating systems, hypervisors, and heterogeneous hardware such
    as GPUs.

-   __Beyond Defense: Toward Resilience__

    ---

    In the era of ubiquitous computing and heterogeneous architectures, security
    is increasingly complex and distributed. These environments require a
    unified ecosystem and adaptable frameworks. Success is not just blocking
    attacks but achieving resilience through rapid recovery, minimal downtime,
    and sustained business continuity.
