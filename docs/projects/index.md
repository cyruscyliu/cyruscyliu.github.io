## Hypervisor Security

## AI System Security

The success of AI is fundamentally reshaping the entire computing stack, from
hardware to high-level software. As new codebases and specialized hardware
emerge to support AI workloads, longstanding security challenges are resurfacing
in modern contexts. Our research investigates security issues across multiple
layers of AI systems, focusing on data, models, AI compilers, operating systems,
hypervisors, and heterogeneous hardware such as GPUs.

## Beyond Defense: Toward Resilience

In the era of ubiquitous computing and heterogeneous architectures, security is
increasingly complex and distributed. These environments require a unified
ecosystem and adaptable frameworks. Success is not just blocking attacks but
achieving resilience through rapid recovery, minimal downtime, and sustained
business continuity.
