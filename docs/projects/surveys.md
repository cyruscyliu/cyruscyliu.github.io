* Keywords: Embedded system security, Hardening and attacks, Embedded inference

Embedded systems power critical applications ranging from satellites and public
transport to agricultural machinery, smart locks, routers, and cameras. Their
security cannot be captured by sample firmware alone, as real-world threats
span multiple layers. At the hardware level, attacks such as voltage glitching
challenge integrity measurement and device resilience, while hardening
techniques aim to close these gaps. At the hardware–software boundary,
co-designed mitigations like MPUs and hypervisors play a key role in isolation
and key management, yet remain targets of sophisticated attacks. At the
software layer, authentication protocols and cryptographic keys are frequently
exposed, undermining device trustworthiness. This survey provides a holistic
view of these challenges and defenses, while also considering the computational
capacity of embedded platforms and their growing role in enabling embedded
inference at the edge.

The objectives are to:

* Compile a representative list of critical embedded devices and their
  firmware
* Survey existing mitigations at the hardware, hardware–software co-design, and
  software levels, along with corresponding attack techniques
* Assess the computational capabilities of embedded systems and examine the
  feasibility and challenges of deploying machine learning inference on these
  platforms

## Trust Across the Skies: Survey of All-Altitude Aero-Space Security

* Keywords: Embedded system security, Hardening and attacks, Embedded inference

All-altitude aero-space security spans diverse targets—including satellites,
aircraft, drones, base stations, and supporting cloud infrastructures—but the
most critical challenge lies in securing the integrated cloud–base
station–aircraft–satellite networks. These multi-layered systems enable global
communication, navigation, and control, yet also introduce cascading
vulnerabilities. An adversary who compromises a single layer, such as a base
station or cloud service, may propagate attacks upward to aircraft or
satellites, or downward to end devices, threatening safety and mission
continuity. Known attack vectors include GPS spoofing, signal jamming, avionics
intrusion, and exploitation of weak authentication and key management in
cross-domain links. Mitigations require coordinated defenses: trusted execution
in aircraft and satellites, integrity verification at base stations, and secure
orchestration in the cloud. Building resilience in these interconnected networks
remains a central challenge, demanding end-to-end designs that unify hardware,
protocol, and system-level defenses across altitudes.

The objectives are to:

* Compile a representative list of aero-space targets
* Survey existing mitigations and attacks

## Hacking Culture

We have focused too much on cool technology while neglecting the fun stories,
nerdy fonts, and meme creativity that are equally important. It's time to
systematically explore and celebrate hacking culture—not just to entertain
ourselves but also to inspire and attract more people to join us.  Parents can
raise children who are independent and creative, teachers can guides students
who are collaborative and competitive, and entrepreneurs can engage customers
who are eager to buy innovative products. Be classy and be cool!
