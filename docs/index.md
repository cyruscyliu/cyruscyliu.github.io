Zhou](https://yajin.org/). His research in cybersecurity focuses on 1)
developing prior-to/after-release security enforcement of software based on deep
understanding, and 2) building the chain of trust examined by full-chain
exploits. His work has been recognized at all the top security conferences: IEEE
S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He received the Best Paper Awards
at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also serving on the program
committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and is a reviewer for ACM
