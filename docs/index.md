## Qiang Liu

System Security Researcher

I am a PostDoc at EPFL in Switzerland, working with [Prof. Mathias
Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the [HexHive
laboratory](https://hexhive.epfl.ch/).  
I earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from Zhejiang
University (ZJU) under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin Zhou](https://yajin.org/).

I seek to establish a **chain of trust spanning the entire technology stack**, from
low-level software to user applications, and from individual computers to
large-scale distributed and heterogeneous systems by:  
- 1) building dynamic analysis platforms to examine the chain of trust through
full-chain exploits, and using these platforms  
- 2) to develop both pre-release vulnerability identification and post-release
vulnerability mitigation techniques,  
- 3) grounded in a deep understanding of software and hardware.
