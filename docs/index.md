## Bio and Contacts [:material-email:](mailto:cyruscyliu@gmail.com) [:fontawesome-brands-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiangliu15/) [:simple-wechat:](weixin://dl/chat?ocat01) [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) [:simple-googlescholar:](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fa1uB2sAAAAJ&hl=en)

Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with [Prof. Mathias
Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the HexHive laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in
2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/). His research interest is system security that seeks
to establish chain of trust spanning the entire technology stack, from low-level
software to user applications, and from individual computers to large-scale
distributed and heterogeneous systems, by 1) building dynamic analysis platforms
to examine the chain of trust through full-chain exploits; and, 2) on top of
these platforms, developing both pre- release vulnerability identification and
post-release attack mitigation techniques, grounded in a deep understanding of
hardware and software. His work has been recognized at all the top security
conferences: IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He received the
Best Paper Awards at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also serving on
the program committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and is a
reviewer for ACM CSUR and ACM TOSEM. See his [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) and [Google
