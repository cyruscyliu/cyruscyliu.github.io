## Research Vision

I investigate
how to establish a **chain of trust spanning the entire technology stack**, from
low-level software to user applications, and from individual computers to
large-scale distributed and heterogeneous systems. To that end, I develop:

- Dynamic analysis platforms capable of reproducing and examining full-chain exploits,  
- Vulnerability techniques, both pre-release detection and post-release mitigation, and  
- Model-driven abstractions that unify software and hardware.

Ultimately, my goal is to builds toward end-to-end trustworthy computing
systems.

## Biography

Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with Prof. Mathias Payer in the HexHive
laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in 2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the
guidance of Prof. Yajin Zhou. His research interest is system security that
seeks to establish chain of trust spanning the entire technology stack, from
low-level software to user applications, and from individual computers to
large-scale distributed and heterogeneous systems, by 1) building dynamic
analysis platforms to examine the chain of trust through full-chain exploits;
and, 2) on top of these platforms, developing both pre- release vulnerability
identification and post-release attack mitigation techniques, grounded in a deep
understanding of hardware and software. His work has been recognized at all the
top security conferences: IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He
received the Best Paper Awards at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also
serving on the program committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and
has reviewed for journals including IEEE TIFS, ACM CSUR, and ACM TOSEM.
