## Bio and Contacts [:material-email:](mailto:cyruscyliu@gmail.com) [:fontawesome-brands-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiangliu15/) [:simple-wechat:](weixin://dl/chat?ocat01) [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) [:simple-googlescholar:](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fa1uB2sAAAAJ&hl=en)

Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with [Prof. Mathias
Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) in the HexHive laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in
2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the guidance of [Prof. Yajin
Zhou](https://yajin.org/). His research in cybersecurity focuses on 1)
developing prior-to/after-release security enforcement of software based on deep
understanding, and 2) building the chain of trust examined by full-chain
exploits. His work has been recognized at all the top security conferences: IEEE
S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He received the Best Paper Awards
at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also serving on the program
committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and is a reviewer for ACM
CSUR and ACM TOSEM. See his [CV](./Qiang_s_CV.pdf) and [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fa1uB2sAAAAJ&hl=en) for more
