## Research Vision

I propose the **OME framework to Observe, Model, and Enforce the trustworthiness
of computer systems at runtime**. Grounded in dynamic analysis, OME treats trust
as a measurable property of execution rather than a static design assumption. I
currently apply it to low-level system software, such as the Linux kernel and
hypervisors, within a single machine. The same observation, modeling, and
enforcement pipeline can scale to higher-level components (for example
interpreters and browsers) and to distributed and heterogeneous environments
(for example network protocols, xPU, and remote resources).

Beyond dynamic analysis, I aim to take **multiple complementary approaches to
support the full lifecycle of system trust**, such as secure programming
languages such as Rust, large-scale static analysis, secure boot and
attestation, and minimal recovery systems, from build to deployment, execution,
and recovery.

Ultimately, my goal is to make computer systems measurably trustworthy,
difficult to compromise, and safe to rely on for different classes of
stakeholders.

## Biography

Qiang Liu is a postdoc at EPFL, working with Prof. Mathias Payer in the HexHive
laboratory. He earned his Ph.D. in 2023 from Zhejiang University (ZJU) under the
guidance of Prof. Yajin Zhou. His research interest is system security that
seeks to establish chain of trust spanning the entire technology stack, from
low-level software to user applications, and from individual computers to
large-scale distributed and heterogeneous systems, grounded in a deep
understanding of hardware and software. His work has been recognized at all the
top security conferences: IEEE S&P, Usenix Security, ACM CCS, and ISOC NDSS. He
received the Best Paper Awards at USENIX Security'24 and ACM RAID'24. He is also
serving on the program committee for IEEE/ACM ASE'25 and USENIX Security'25 and
has reviewed for journals including IEEE TIFS, ACM CSUR, and ACM TOSEM.
